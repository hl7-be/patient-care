WARNING: ImplementationGuide.url: The canonical URL for an Implementation Guide must point directly to the implementation guide resource, not to the Implementation Guide as a whole
WARNING: Unable to find ImplementationGuide.definition.resource.description for the resource Patient/patient1.  Descriptions are strongly encouraged if they cannot be inferred from the resource to allow proper population of the artifact list.

WARNING: StructureDefinition/BeModelTask: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[5].type[0].profile[0]: There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-reference'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '5.2.0', found versions: 4.0.1, 5.1.0, 5.2.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-reference' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/valueset-reference|5.2.0'
